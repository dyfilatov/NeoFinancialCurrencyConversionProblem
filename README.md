Currency conversion problem solution by Danil Filatov for the Neo Financial assessment.

The solution consists of two parts: console application and tests.
To run the code you need .NET 7 SDK installed. You can get it by URL https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0
If you don't want to install SDK on your machine, then you can build and run Dockerfile.

The best way to run and view the code is to use Jetbrains Rider.
The simplest way to run the application is to run the command "dotnet run" in the directory "..NeoFinancialCurrencyConversionProblem\NeoFinancialCurrencyConversionProblem\"

The application has console logging.
